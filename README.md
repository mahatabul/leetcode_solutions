## About

LeetCode is a platform that offers a wide range of coding problems to help improve your algorithmic skills and prepare for technical interviews. In this repository, you will find my solutions to different problems. Each solution is structured as follows:



### 1. **Problem Title**
   - Clearly identifies the problem by its LeetCode problem number and title.



### 2. **Company**
   - Lists the companies associated with the problem (e.g., Uber, Apple, Amazon, Google, C3 IoT).



### 3. **Difficulty**
   - Indicates the difficulty level of the problem (e.g., **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**).



### 4. **Problem Statement**
   - Provides a detailed description of the problem.
   - Includes:
     - The scenario (e.g., finding subarrays with a specific sum in a binary array).
     - Definitions of key terms.
     - The goal of the problem.



### 5. **Examples**
   - Provides concrete examples with:
     - Input.
     - Output.
     - Explanation of the reasoning behind the output.



### 6. **Constraints**
   - Lists the constraints for the input (e.g., size of `nums`, range of values).



### 7. **Approach**
   - Describes the strategy used to solve the problem.
   - Includes:
     - Key steps (e.g., prefix sum and hash map).
     - Explanation of the logic.
     - Time and space complexity analysis.



### 8. **Solutions**
   - Provides code implementations in multiple programming languages.
   - Each solution is clearly labeled (e.g., `### C++ Solution`, `### Python Solution`).
   - Code is well-formatted and includes comments where necessary.
